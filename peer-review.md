*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
 I was unable to break it except for a warning from chrome saying:
 A cookie associated with a cross-site resource at http://jsdelivr.net/ was set without the `SameSite` attribute. A future release of Chrome will only deliver cookies with cross-site requests if they are set with `SameSite=None` and `Secure`.
 + This console warning is not an error or an actual problem â€” Chrome is just spreading the word about this new standard to increase developer adoption.   The release date for a fix is 02/04/2020 per: https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
Very clean interface. 

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
There were no comments but no standard for comments was ever discussed

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
use of Verify library and the use of outside API's for data went beyond the scope of the assignment and showed a high level of self learning.

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
No

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
No
