                The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two
                completely
                rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do
                so. It
                was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950.

                    <li>You and Jane are robbers that are arrested while waiting across the street from a bank that you
                        planned
                        to rob that night.</li>
                    <li>You are separated from Jane and have no means of communicating with her.</li>
                    <li>Law enforcement lack sufficient evidence to convict you both on the charge of roberry, but they
                        have enough to convict both on a lesser charge of lottering. </li>
                    <li>Simultaneously, the detectives offer each of you a bargain: You are given the opportunity either
                        to betray the other by testifying that the other
                        committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. </li>

                            <li>If you betray the Jane but Jane remains silent, you will be set free and Jane will serve
                                three years in prison</li>
                            <li>If Jane betrays you but you remain silent, Jane will be set free and you will serve
                                three
                                years in prison</li>
                            <li>If both of you remain silent, both of you will serve only one year in prison on the
                                lesser
                                charge of lottering.</li>
